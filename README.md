This is a little script to save the diffs of all your uncommitted Git and
Subversion working copies; usage is simple:

    Usage: auto-commit.rb [options] ROOTS
        --dest DIR
        
Just specify a `--dest DIR` to store the diffs, and some `ROOTS` to scan for
Git and Subversion working copies.
